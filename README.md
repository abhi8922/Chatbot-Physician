# Chatbot-Physician
Develop a healthcare chatbot with features like symptom checker, medical advice, appointment scheduling, and educational materials. Use GPT for NLP, STT/TTS for voice interaction, and Unity/Ready Player Me for avatars. Train models on datasets like MIMIC-III and MedMNIST. Deploy via AWS with web/mobile integration, ensuring continuous improvements.
1. Define the Scope
Features:
Disease symptom checker and medical advice.
General healthcare information.
Scheduling appointments.
Providing educational materials.
Functionalities:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for chat.
Voice interaction (speech input and output).
Visual avatar for human-like interaction.
2. Components and Tools
Chatbot Backend:
NLP Framework: Use Hugging Face's Transformers, OpenAI GPT, or Rasa for the conversational model.
Disease Diagnosis: Train or fine-tune a model on medical datasets.
Voice Interaction:
Speech-to-Text (STT): Use libraries like Google Speech API, Whisper, or Vosk.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Use TTS libraries like Google TTS, Amazon Polly, or Coqui.
Avatar:
Use Unity, Unreal Engine, or Ready Player Me to design an avatar with animations and lip sync.
Frontend:
Web app: React, Flask/Django backend.
Mobile app: Flutter or React Native.
3. Datasets
Images Dataset for Avatar Customization:
Datasets:
CelebA Dataset for facial features.
Deep Fashion for clothing styles.
Disease Diagnosis Dataset:
General Datasets:
MIMIC-III: Clinical data.
MedMNIST: Lightweight medical image datasets.
CheXpert: Chest X-ray data.
Kaggle Datasets: Datasets on disease symptoms, diagnosis, and imaging.
Symptom Checkers:
Extract from public healthcare APIs (like WHO datasets or symptom checkers like Infermedica).
4. Model Development
Conversational AI:
Fine-tune GPT models for healthcare dialogues using custom datasets.
Use frameworks like Rasa for specific intent recognition and entity extraction.
Disease Prediction:
Use classification models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for imaging-based diagnosis.
Use decision tree/ensemble methods for symptoms-to-disease prediction.
5. Voice Interaction Pipeline
Speech Recognition (STT):
Process input speech to text.
Language Understanding:
Pass the recognized text to the chatbot model for response generation.
Voice Synthesis (TTS):
Convert the generated text to speech for user output.
6. Avatar Integration
Design or use pre-built avatars capable of real-time lip-syncing using platforms like:
Ready Player Me.
Unity-based character customization.
Integrate using real-time animation libraries (e.g., NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face).
7. Deployment
Hosting: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability.
Interfaces:
Web-based chatbot: HTML/CSS/JavaScript + Flask/Node.js backend.
Mobile app: Use Flutter or React Native.
Integration:
Combine speech interaction, chatbot API, and avatar interface into a unified platform.
8. Testing and Validation
Validate the chatbot using:
Medical professionals for accuracy.
User feedback for conversational flow and avatar usability.
9. Iterative Improvement
Continuously fine-tune the model with new data.
